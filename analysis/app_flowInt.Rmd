# Flow Cytometry Integration{.tabset .tabset-fade}

I've built a flow cytometry app which automates a lot of the repetitive processes involved in the Spectre R package. 

Particularly, it allows you to set individual cofactors for scaling channel values. The default is to set a single cofactor, which may be comparable to setting the same axes setting in FlowJo for all channels. Each channel may need to be adjusted individually, and this app allows you to do this comparatively rapidly. 

The authors of the [Spectre site](https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/cytometry/#tutorials) provide more details on how to use the app, such as transformations and choosing markers for clustering. 

### Step 1: R set up

I've made a template folder for this analysis: [download](https://github.com/DrThomasOneil/CVR-site/raw/refs/heads/master/docs/assets/apps/flow_template.zip)

The folder structure when unzipped will be: 

```{r, eval=F}

flow_template
  |
  |_app_flow.R
  |
  |_flow
  |  |_sample1.csv
  |  |_sample2.cs
  |_meta
  |_output

```

**Open the** `app_flow.R` **file.**
 
Here you'll see a few lines that you need to run first. 

To set your working directory:    
`wd <- dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)`    
`setwd(wd)`

In case you've buggered with the folder structure:  
`if(!file.exists("flow")){dir.create("flow")}`  
`if(!file.exists("meta")){dir.create("meta")}`  
`if(!file.exists("output")){dir.create("output"); dir.create("output/rds"); dir.create("output/features")}`   

And packages you'll need to install and load:
```{r eval=F}
library(Spectre)
library(Seurat)
library(ggplot2)
library(shiny)
library(DT)
library(data.table)
```


### Step 2: Add flow data to the 'flow' folder

From FlowJo, you'll want to export your parent population (e.g. CD4+ T cells, MNPs, B cells, All Immune cells) as a csv.

You'll need to export as **Scale values**, and make sure you select compensated channels. 

Export/move these files to the `/flow` folder. 

### Step 3: Adjust cofactors and filters

In the original Spectre script, you have the option to set a single cofactor. This is almost equivalent to setting the scale once in flowjo to apply to all channels. We know using tissue and different samples/batches sometimes requires drastically different transformations. 

The [Spectre site](https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/cytometry/#tutorials) provides details on transformations

To do this manually, I might think would be a bit of a nightmare. So I've made the first app so that you are able to view and set thresholds per marker per sample. 

To get started, run the app using:    
`source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVR-MucosalImmunology/Rshiny/refs/heads/main/flow_setup.R");shinyApp(ui,server);rm(ui,server)`

#### How to use:

1. You'll first load in a sample by selecting one and clicking **Update sample**. 
2. This will load in the channels. Select the channel you want to adjust, and then a Y channel. Click both **Update axes** and **Update plot**. 
3. Adjust the `arcsinh cofactor` and `filter` values on the right for each channel. Adjust the filter to remove lower outlier values. Increasing the `cofactor` value squishes values into the negative more. You might notice that when you use a value that is two low, it starts to split the negative into two populations. This value therefore needs to be somewhat informed by the user. 
4. Once you're happy with the threshold, click `Add Data`. You'll notice that the table on the right hand side updates. 
5. Not every marker needs to be adjusted - just markers you wish to view after analysis (including markers you don't plan on clustering with).
6. Click `Save` when you're done. This should then add a `.csv` file to the `meta/` folder in your root directory. If you want to come back and adjust any values, you have the option to do so by just directly editing this file. 
7. Repeat this for all samples you want to integrate! 

<details><summary>Notes:</summary>

- You'll notice two extra buttons. Phenotypic and Cluster marker. These are redundant and I'll probably remove these at a later time. 
- As I said in step 6, you can just directly adjust the csv's in excel. Make sure not to change anything unnecessarily. The rpca app relies on this.

### Step 4: RPCA integration

After you've set the co-factors and filters, you can run the rpca integration app. 

`source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVR-MucosalImmunology/Rshiny/refs/heads/main/flow_integration.R");shinyApp(ui,server);rm(ui,server)`

This app takes the files in the `flow/` and corresponding `meta/` folder. This is where it becomes very efficient. 

You can choose which samples you want to integrate. It'll then load the markers to choose from. Click **Run RPCA** and wait. Depending on the number of samples, it may take a while. If you're worried, go to the RStudio window and you'll see the functions running in the background. 

Some things to consider:

- To run quickly, this function cuts the samples down to 6000 cells. If you want to run more cells, let me know and we can adjust the script to choose cell numbers, or change the code itself.   
- ...

To do this manually could take quite a while. Now you're able to rapidly remove samples that aren't working, remove or add markers to check how they alter the clustering, etc. 

#### Visualisation

You can now check where markers are lying on the Umap by selecting a marker and clicking **Update**.


#### SOMS clustering

You can also very rapidly test out different k cluster values. Change the `clusters` value and click **Update K**. 

#### Export data

When you're happy with integration and SOMS clustering, you can export all data and graphs. Change the `prefix` to make the output files unique (in case you want to export more than once).

What is exported is:    
  
- Pre and post integration graphs   
- SOMS cluster umap   
- The expression plots of each marker used for clustering   
- The rmd of the data
